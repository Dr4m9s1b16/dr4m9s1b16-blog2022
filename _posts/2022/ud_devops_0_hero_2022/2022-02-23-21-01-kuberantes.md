Kubernates is the most poular container Orchestration tool , It is used to prevent 
single point docker engine failure


## Node running Docker

Above diagram illustrates containers runnning in a single docker engine , what happen if docker engine failed.

## Clustering

So inorder to mitigate single point of failure we use cluster of docker engines.

- We are clustering the docker engines ,and we have a master node which controls all the other  docker nodes.
- Master node give instructions to docker nodes to where to run containers and , distribute containers across the docker node.
- In case any of the docker node fails , we can run the containers in the live docker engines ,and It will start automatically in the docker engine.

![dockerengine]({{ site.baseurl }}/post_img/2022/02/23/4.png)

In here all the docker node is single pool of resource , which is fault tolerant.As well as continuous orchestration done for production environment,but you can run normal containers on them as well.

## Container Orchestartion tools

- Docker Swarm
- Kubernates
- Mesophere Marathon
- AWS ECS & EKS
- Azure Container Service
- Google Conatiner Engine
- CoreOS Fleet
- OpenShift

## Kubernates advantages

 - kubernates manage the cluster of docker engine.
 - Manage other run time environment like rocket
 - Create service discovery container which is called `Pod`
 - Storgae orchestration , give opportnity to run `chef storage` , `EBS`
 - Autoametd roll out and rollbacks ,easy to update a image version , rollback easily if it is not working
 - Automated bin packing , place the container in the right node and resource,compute resources are well utilized
 - Self-healing, bring the containers to live in the live node aslo the containers also monitored like auto scaling group

## Kubernates Architecture

![dockerengine]({{ site.baseurl }}/post_img/2022/02/23/5.png)

- <mark>worker node</mark> - where docker engines are running
- <mark>master node</mark> - master node is the one manage the worker node , act as a control plane
    - API Server
    - Scheduler
    - Controller Manager
- <mark>yaml file</mark> - connect master node by client , instructions are given through YAML file

**These are four primary service in kubernates :**

- <mark>API Server</mark>
    - Manage Pods
    - Manage Services
- <mark>Control Manager</mark>
- <mark>Scheduler</mark>
- <mark>Etcd</mark>


**Worker Node contains :**
- kubelet
- proxy 
- docker engine

### Master:Kube API Server

![dockerengine]({{ site.baseurl }}/post_img/2022/02/23/6.png)

- API Server handles all the requests and enables communication across stack services
- There are so many integration available for kupe api server - montoring , logging , web dashboards etc.
- This is the component which exposes kubernates API
- It is the front end for the kubernates control plane.

- `kubectl CLI` - Command line interface connects to the API network ,we use kubectl CLI to access the kubernates cluster.

### Master:ETCD Server

- key value storage , high availability key value store used as kubernetes backing
store for all data
- stores all the information.
- kube api used to store and retrieve info from it
- It backed up regularly
- Save current state of everything in the cluster

### Master:Kube Scheduler

- Schedule the container in the right node.
- watches newly created pods that have no node assigned,and selects a node for them to run on
- Based on the resource requirements , depends on harware/software/policy constraints.
- Afinity and Anti-afinity specifications , run the container on this particular node or just the opposite.
- Data locality 
- inter- workload interference and deadlines

### Master:Controller Manager

- Controller is a group of multiple things that are running to reduce the complexity.
- Logically , each controller is a separate process
- to rduce complexity , they are all compiled into a single binary and run in a single process

- Controller Manager:
    - Node controller - monitor your worker node,node goes down it will take some actions.
    - Replication controller - It will monitor your pods/container,It will do the auto healing.
    - End Point controller - Populate the endpoint object,Join services and pods
    - Service account and token controller - Manage the authentication and authorization

## Node Components

![dockerengine]({{ site.baseurl }}/post_img/2022/02/23/7.png)

### Kubelet

- `Kubelet` that is referred as agent.It make sure that containers are running in a pod
- It will run on every node , it will listen the Kubernates master request or commands
- Schedulaer assign if this worker node need to run the container it assigns the responsibiltiy to kubelet
- Kubelet fetch your image from the container from it , so it will do the heavy lifting , It will run the docker commands.

### Kube Proxy

- network proxy that runs on each node in your cluster.
- You can set Network rules , Like security group rules we allow or deny that.
- rules allow network communication to your;Pods or putside of your cluster.

### Container Run time

- Kubernates is flexible in that you have :

	- docker engine
	- containerd
	- cri-o , rktlet
	- kubernates CRI (Container Runtime Interface)

If you go with docker swarm , you can only use docker engine , but with kubernates it will use other run time environment.

## Addons

These things are taken by third party vendors , better  logging tool , better monitoring tool or web user interface or even DNS service.

- DNS
- WebUI
- Container Resource Monitoring
- Cluster Level Logging

## Overview

![dockerengine]({{ site.baseurl }}/post_img/2022/02/23/8.png)

Master node

- kubectl => the tool used to connect the kubernative master
- etcd => store the current information
- API Server =>Enables the communication with worker node and master node.
- Scheduler => decides where your container will be running on which node
- Cotroller manager => responsibel work managing worker node , your containers as well as authentication authorization.

worker node

- where you have kubelet
- kubelet is an agent running in the worker node , you can do all the heavy lifting in the container
	- fetch the image
	- run the container
	- Map the volumes etc
- kupe proxy - if you want to expose the pods to outside the world you can do with kube proxy or even you set the network rules and the docker engine also.
- container closed in the pod

## Pod and Container

![dockerengine]({{ site.baseurl }}/post_img/2022/02/23/9.png)

- Same as VM has process in it , VM will give all the resources for process that running on VM Example : RAM , CPU ,STORAGE,EVERYTHING and the process that used to it.

- Similar way,pod will give all the resources to container, container will run inside the Pod ,  Container is like a process and Pod is like a VM.

**1. Why kubernative uses pod why not run the containers directly?**

- Because kubernative contains different run time environment like  docker , rocket , cri.
- If you don't have the pod there is no extraction.
- We can use standard set of command , configuration, we don't mine what technologies , we are using behind the scene.
- So pod uses the abstarction,Pod is going to do that to container inside it.

Example:- If you run the tomcat process inside the container, which is running on the port 8080, the pod will give the IP address , and access it by giving pod ip and the port number of the container.

> **In a pod we can have one or more conatiner**

**2. Can you run the multiple containers inside the Pod, It really depends?**

![dockerengine]({{ site.baseurl }}/post_img/2022/02/23/10.png)

- if you see one container running inside the pod other container will be helper container

**In Node 1**

- you have a pod and main container running inside that => one pod one container.

**In Node 2**

- One is sidecar and another one is init => Init conatiner is short lived container , start and does some command execution and then it will be dead.

- when it dead then main container will start, side car container help will to help the main container. like streaming the log , It is like a logging agent  or a monitoring agent  to help your main container.

- But in a given time one main container running in the pod , other containers will be helper containers.

- If you have tomcat and mysql you can't run it on same pod , you have to run it on different different pods

## Overlay Network

- When you conside Node 1 tomcat needs to interact with Node 3 my sql how will they interact.

![dockerengine]({{ site.baseurl }}/post_img/2022/02/23/11.png)

- you have a joint network node that connect every nodes, and every node you have a subnet like a local area network or private network running inside the node.

- There is a  bridge 0 which acts like a switch.

    - all the podes which is running on the Node 1 communicate with bridge 0

- when connecting to a container which is running on another node

    - bridge 0 forward the request to wg0 that act like a router => looking at the ip address it routed to other node wg0 that forwrded to switch and switch send that to Pod => this is for understanding.

## Kubernates SetUp tools

- HardWay:Manual SetUp
- MiniKube - one node kuberanates cluster
    - setup one node kubernative cluster in the computer , so it is launch a virtual machine using virtual box and in that one machine master node and worker node will be running,Only for testing and learning purposes not really production

- Kubeadm - Multi node kubernates cluster
    - Can be created on any platforms vm's,ec2,physical machines
    - login to master node run some commands , log into worker node run some commands finally they are connected, you can do it for physical machine , virtual for anything, there is lot of manual test to execute.

- kops - multi node kubernates cluster on AWS
    - Most good way to run the kubernative cluster
    - Now supported on multiple cluster
