## 1-Understanding channels

- channels are better way to synchronzing your code and writing concurrent code. 

- here is a channel, where I put integers.

![dockerengine]({{ site.baseurl }}/post_img/2022/03/13_2/1.jpg)

- channels are the little place where we send data

![dockerengine]({{ site.baseurl }}/post_img/2022/03/13_2/2.jpg)

- that means channels lock
- when to put 42 in the channel it blocks, you send and receive on a channel it's like relay race or is racers in a track race that they have to pass it hand to hand and the transaction cannot occur,It can occur until both `send and receive can happen at the same time at the same time.` 
- send and receive blocks until the receiver is ready to pull it off.
- channels block 

### way 1 implement channels

- flow continuous right just continue down to this one and `<-c` blocks until it take the value off

### Way 2 implement channels

- buffer channel => buffered channel is a channel that will allow certain values to sit in that channel regardless of whether or something is ready to pull off.
![dockerengine]({{ site.baseurl }}/post_img/2022/03/13_2/7.jpg)

- It will allow one value to sit in there.

## 2.Directional channels

- channels are one directional, you can only send to the channel and receive it from the channel.

![dockerengine]({{ site.baseurl }}/post_img/2022/03/13_2/17.jpg)

![dockerengine]({{ site.baseurl }}/post_img/2022/03/13_2/18.jpg)


![dockerengine]({{ site.baseurl }}/post_img/2022/03/13_2/19.jpg)

- It is send only we can't receive from it.

![dockerengine]({{ site.baseurl }}/post_img/2022/03/13_2/20.jpg)


![dockerengine]({{ site.baseurl }}/post_img/2022/03/13_2/21.jpg)

- It is receive only channel

![dockerengine]({{ site.baseurl }}/post_img/2022/03/13_2/22.jpg)

## 3.Using channels

- In this function `c` is just  like the slice of the reference type, referencing the same underlying array and we looked at some nuances.

- But this channel here we only going to be able to put a value onto it.

![dockerengine]({{ site.baseurl }}/post_img/2022/03/13_2/36.jpg)

- Above foo and bar runs in their own goroutine, so our control flow centers

![dockerengine]({{ site.baseurl }}/post_img/2022/03/13_2/37.jpg)

![dockerengine]({{ site.baseurl }}/post_img/2022/03/13_2/38.jpg)

- so this entire transaction between those two men might not have time to happen
- becasue these two functions are in different goroutine , sometimes it will not happen

![dockerengine]({{ site.baseurl }}/post_img/2022/03/13_2/39.jpg)


- this wait until the value come to access in bar , this make sense.

![dockerengine]({{ site.baseurl }}/post_img/2022/03/13_2/40.jpg)


![dockerengine]({{ site.baseurl }}/post_img/2022/03/13_2/41.jpg)


![dockerengine]({{ site.baseurl }}/post_img/2022/03/13_2/42.jpg)

## 4.Range

- ranging over channel and closing the channel.

![dockerengine]({{ site.baseurl }}/post_img/2022/03/13_2/43.jpg)


![dockerengine]({{ site.baseurl }}/post_img/2022/03/13_2/44.jpg)


![dockerengine]({{ site.baseurl }}/post_img/2022/03/13_2/45.jpg)


- foo(), `c` will be a new memory addrees area , channel that sends on to it 
`c <- 42` so it is a send channel , sending values onto the channel 

![dockerengine]({{ site.baseurl }}/post_img/2022/03/13_2/46.jpg)


![dockerengine]({{ site.baseurl }}/post_img/2022/03/13_2/47.jpg)

![dockerengine]({{ site.baseurl }}/post_img/2022/03/13_2/50.jpg)

## 5.Select

- range loop hangout until the channel is closed, go routine that putting values on to the channel, and a main goroutine will pulls of value from channel , and when we are done putting them on closed channel over this go routine, and then this one will pull all the values off that are still there
Now that is close Knit and last values off,It's will continue its flow

- How could you range over your channels , `channels block`,` range clause also block until the channel closed`


![dockerengine]({{ site.baseurl }}/post_img/2022/03/13_2/51.jpg)

![dockerengine]({{ site.baseurl }}/post_img/2022/03/13_2/52.jpg)

![dockerengine]({{ site.baseurl }}/post_img/2022/03/13_2/53.jpg)


![dockerengine]({{ site.baseurl }}/post_img/2022/03/13_2/54.jpg)


![dockerengine]({{ site.baseurl }}/post_img/2022/03/13_2/55.jpg)

![dockerengine]({{ site.baseurl }}/post_img/2022/03/13_2/56.jpg)

![dockerengine]({{ site.baseurl }}/post_img/2022/03/13_2/57.jpg)


![dockerengine]({{ site.baseurl }}/post_img/2022/03/13_2/58.jpg)

- above works fine

 ###  6. Comma Ok idiom

![dockerengine]({{ site.baseurl }}/post_img/2022/03/13_2/60.jpg)

![dockerengine]({{ site.baseurl }}/post_img/2022/03/13_2/66.jpg)

![dockerengine]({{ site.baseurl }}/post_img/2022/03/13_2/67.jpg)

- `i,ok` to check whether channel is closed or not

![dockerengine]({{ site.baseurl }}/post_img/2022/03/13_2/68.jpg)

![dockerengine]({{ site.baseurl }}/post_img/2022/03/13_2/69.jpg)

![dockerengine]({{ site.baseurl }}/post_img/2022/03/13_2/70.jpg)

- that is give us an address

![dockerengine]({{ site.baseurl }}/post_img/2022/03/13_2/71.jpg)

![dockerengine]({{ site.baseurl }}/post_img/2022/03/13_2/72.jpg)

### 7.Fan In

![dockerengine]({{ site.baseurl }}/post_img/2022/03/13_2/74.jpg)



![dockerengine]({{ site.baseurl }}/post_img/2022/03/13_2/75.jpg)

- In above code we taking values from two channels , and put them into one channel, we fan from multiple channels to one channel.

## 8. Fan Out

- run 10 work at a time

![dockerengine]({{ site.baseurl }}/post_img/2022/03/13_2/83.jpg)

## throttle throughout

![dockerengine]({{ site.baseurl }}/post_img/2022/03/13_2/91.jpg)

## 9.Context

- context is the tool that you could use with your con current design pattern, when a process launch whole bunch of other goroutines

- when you decide to cancel that one process all of the launched go routines
also all the go routines also counsel.

- you don't leak the go routines, It's called leaking go routines by using up resources, when part of the process you launch a bunch of goroutines and when you close this process down , but these routines are still out here and run and that's using up resources.

- So I have a internal loop out here,that's always running and when this one shuts , this is related to that if this launched that we want all of those out there launched.

- So context can help you with that context which help you with like passing around variables which are related to a request and so context takes.

![dockerengine]({{ site.baseurl }}/post_img/2022/03/13_2/100.jpg)

- error is `nil` because we couldn't cancel any stuff.

![dockerengine]({{ site.baseurl }}/post_img/2022/03/13_2/101.jpg)

![dockerengine]({{ site.baseurl }}/post_img/2022/03/13_2/102.jpg)
![dockerengine]({{ site.baseurl }}/post_img/2022/03/13_2/103.jpg)

![dockerengine]({{ site.baseurl }}/post_img/2022/03/13_2/104.jpg)

- weare cancelled the goroutine but it is want one more to run , becasue it launched a goroutine before  calling`cancel()` so it will run.

- all the goroutines are shut down other than main , we will give a timeout a deadline and then just cancel your routines that are out there when we are done.

- You can also do `defer.cancel()` , when main exits like all of them shut down. shutting down the goroutines and not leaking the goroutines
